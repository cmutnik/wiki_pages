# JavaScript Basics



### Read in File
To read in a file and print its contents to the HTML page, look in [`readinfile/`](./readinfile/) and [`readinfileUsingCSS/`](./readinfileUsingCSS/).

In [`readinfile/`](./readinfile/):
<br>
The page `ChooseFileToReadAndPrint.html` calls the JS script `app.js` and allows a user to choose the file the want to read-in and print to the HTML page.
<br>
Changing `textarea` to `pre`, in the following line: 
```html
<textarea id="fileContents"></textarea>
```
removes the text box and just prints directly to the HTML page.

### Read in File and Print to Console
Use [`readinPrintConsole/index.html`](readinPrintConsole/index.html)
