# JavaScript Basics

### Read in File
The page `ChooseFileToReadAndPrint.html` calls the JS script `app.js` and allows a user to choose the file the want to read-in and print to the HTML page.

Changing `textarea` to `pre`, in the following line: 
```html
<textarea id="fileContents"></textarea>
```
removes the text box and just prints directly to the HTML page.
